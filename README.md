# Caesar-Cipher



    [ABOUT]

-   Encode and decode messages using the Caesar Cipher, which dates back to around 45 B.C. 
-   The cipher works by shifting the original letter to a new letter.


    [SECURITY AND STRENGTH]

 -  With modern computing and better cryptologists, this encryption method is just as weak as writing in plain text.
    With that said, the Caesar Cipher represents a historical turning point in cryptology and is an excellent starting point for beginners and young students.
